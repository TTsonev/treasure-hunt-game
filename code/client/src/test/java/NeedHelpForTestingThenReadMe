You can find tutorial slides on unit testing on Moodle.
Further there is an example project covering jUnit5 and Mockito in depth showing you how to write unit tests and mocks, also available on Moodle.
In addition, a Unit Testing tutorial will be given (highly recommended).
Note, the gradle configuration of this project is already configured correctly so that you can start writing unit tests with jUnit5 and Mockito without any need to adapt the given gradle configuration. 
I would recommend that you add the tests in this folder. Respect single responsability while doing so, i.e., create multiple packages, classes, and so on to store the unit tests.
Take the covered best practices for unit testing into account.
